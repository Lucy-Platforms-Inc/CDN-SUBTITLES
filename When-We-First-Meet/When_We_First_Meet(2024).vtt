00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.616
I love you yuri

2
00:01:07.616 --> 00:01:10.250
I hope we stay together forever and ever

3
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.083
Why so sudden my love?

4
00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:14.566
Of course we’ll stay together and forever

5
00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:15.616
I love you too

6
00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:17.133
Ikaw talaga ah
(*Nag lalandian ang mga juding*)

7
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.000
Ikaw ah
(*Nag lalandian ang mga juding*)

8
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.700
(*Nag lalandian ang mga juding*)

9
00:01:21.516 --> 00:01:22.400
Where's that boy

10
00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.200
Where's that boy

11
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:33.866
Why isn’t this boy answering?!

12
00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.099
I swear if he’s with that Keifer guy again-

13
00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.400
ikaw ah

14
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.216
Wait lang wait lang

15
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:41.549
Hi mom!

16
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.766
Yes yes yes I’m going home, don't worry

17
00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:44.799
Yuri!

18
00:01:45.483 --> 00:01:47.000
Are you with that Keifer guy again?

19
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.000
I swear,

20
00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:49.583
go home right now.

21
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.950
I don’t want you hanging out with that person.

22
00:01:52.016 --> 00:01:53.566
He’s influencing you badly!

23
00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:56.866
But Mom! I thought we'd already talked about this.

24
00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:57.816
I love him okay?

25
00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.683
I don’t wanna hear your scolding anymore.

26
00:01:59.983 --> 00:02:02.483
I’m old enough to decide for myself and you know that.

27
00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:04.183
Go home at once!

28
00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:10.483
Whats that about?

29
00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:11.483
*Sighs*

30
00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.349
Its my mom

31
00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.750
Dont worry about it

32
00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.199
But I really need to go home

33
00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:19.599
It’s okay I understand. I’ll walk you back home.

34
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.750
No no no its ok

35
00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:22.583
I'l- i'll walk alone

36
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.016
Pretty sure my mom doesn’t even want to see you anymore

37
00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:27.016
sorry, I’m very sorry.

38
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.333
Ok walk safe

39
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.133
Call me once you got home okay?

40
00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:30.616
Bye!

41
00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:33.400
(Yuri's House)

42
00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:38.199
(knocks)

43
00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:41.650
I'm Home

44
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.983
Where have you been? I’ve been worried sick-

45
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.583
Mom Just-

46
00:02:47.583 --> 00:02:49.300
Don't be over dramatic okay?

47
00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:51.583
(*Furious*) Are you with that Keifer again?

48
00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:54.183
Yes i am

49
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.150
But

50
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.566
What is it to you?

51
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.366
How many times do I need to say and repeat it?!

52
00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.733
Your relationship with Keifer is a sin!

53
00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.416
It’s a sin against God’s eyes!

54
00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:06.016
I get what your trying to say mom!

55
00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:09.449
You kept telling it to me every single time

56
00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.266
But that doesn't change the fact

57
00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:13.550
That i still love Him!

58
00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:16.283
(*Shocked*) Are you hearing yourself right now?!

59
00:03:16.716 --> 00:03:17.766
Go to your room!

60
00:03:17.766 --> 00:03:19.083
You’re grounded from now on!

61
00:03:19.416 --> 00:03:19.900
What!?

62
00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:20.516
But!?

63
00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:22.416
(*Speechless*)

64
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.650
(*kicked the wall*)

65
00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:28.833
(*Keifer's House*)

66
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.683
Dad?

67
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.300
I'm Home

68
00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:39.266
Son! Go ahead and eat first. I’m gonna take a nap since I have a duty later.

69
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.050
Yes Keifer

70
00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:41.366
Yes Keifer

71
00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:43.066
May i have your advice

72
00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:45.150
Yes, What is it? Something bothering you?

73
00:03:45.216 --> 00:03:45.683
Yes

74
00:03:46.566 --> 00:03:47.566
Is it love life?

75
00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:48.066
Yes

76
00:03:49.616 --> 00:03:50.666
Its about that "Guy"

77
00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:53.800
That Guy" the one that you have telling me

78
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.066
A million times already

79
00:03:55.866 --> 00:03:56.366
Yes

80
00:03:56.833 --> 00:03:59.266
His mother is against our relationship.

81
00:03:59.466 --> 00:04:00.650
Well may i know why?

82
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.050
His mom is a religious person

83
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.116
And

84
00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:08.283
And she says that it is a sin

85
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.033
Uh huh…

86
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.250
Well son

87
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.066
in this world

88
00:04:13.066 --> 00:04:15.633
Everyone has a different perspectives and beliefs

89
00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:18.633
You can’t really change someone's mindset, right?

90
00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:20.516
I get your point dad

91
00:04:20.683 --> 00:04:22.550
But its her own beliefs

92
00:04:22.816 --> 00:04:23.683
And

93
00:04:24.266 --> 00:04:26.066
I think that She should not force on us.

94
00:04:26.383 --> 00:04:29.100
And We are old enough, to make our own decisions

95
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.883
Right?

96
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.500
Son, I also get your point. But hear me out. You know that I support both you and Yuri, right?

97
00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:39.350
Yes

98
00:04:40.066 --> 00:04:45.949
Right. I’m not defending Yuri’s mother, but she has the right to be against your relationship.

99
00:04:46.116 --> 00:04:50.316
You’ve mentioned that she is a religious person, so what can you expect?

100
00:04:50.483 --> 00:04:56.250
They believe that God only created men and women. A man is only for women, and women is only for men

101
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.949
Just like what Genesis 1:27 says

102
00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:00.516
Dad

103
00:05:00.883 --> 00:05:02.399
I dont get your point

104
00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:04.466
I'm a human i have feelings

105
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:05.916
I love yuri

106
00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:07.149
I love Him

107
00:05:07.483 --> 00:05:08.766
No because of His gender

108
00:05:09.483 --> 00:05:09.966
But

109
00:05:10.566 --> 00:05:11.133
Because of

110
00:05:11.916 --> 00:05:13.550
For who He is

111
00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:14.516
Do you get me?

112
00:05:14.666 --> 00:05:15.949
I get your side son

113
00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:17.850
But lets face reality

114
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.949
Like what I’ve said earlier, you can’t force your belief on someone else.

115
00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.283
Everyone has a different perspective and belief's.

116
00:05:25.633 --> 00:05:28.066
What matters is that we respect each other, right?

117
00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:29.466
Yes dad

118
00:05:29.466 --> 00:05:29.916
but

119
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.466
I dont think that

120
00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:35.083
I'll- I can keep my distance from him

121
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.766
You know?

122
00:05:36.766 --> 00:05:41.133
His Mom wants us to break up and never associate again!

123
00:05:41.516 --> 00:05:43.033
Give it a time son

124
00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:45.300
Don’t rush in making decisions

125
00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:48.266
I know that you’ll be able to figure it out

126
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.000
Plus, you could talk to me when you need help, right?

127
00:05:51.816 --> 00:05:52.600
*sigh*

128
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.533
Yes dad

129
00:05:54.766 --> 00:05:55.699
Thank you

130
00:05:57.333 --> 00:05:58.399
(*At the School*)

131
00:05:59.116 --> 00:06:00.216
Hey Keifer!

132
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.699
I haven’t seen you and Yuri around lately! What’s up?

133
00:06:03.283 --> 00:06:04.116
Uhh

134
00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:05.283
Nothing really

135
00:06:05.516 --> 00:06:08.149
Have you heard anything about Yuri?

136
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.033
Well, I haven’t seen him much except when we have classes together.

137
00:06:12.266 --> 00:06:13.216
Im worried sick

138
00:06:13.216 --> 00:06:15.699
He hasn't chatted me or called me yet

139
00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:16.966
Since yesterday

140
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.199
oh, actually

141
00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.033
earlier

142
00:06:19.316 --> 00:06:22.183
I peeked at his phone and i saw his mother's messages

143
00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:22.666
Huh!?

144
00:06:22.666 --> 00:06:23.216
Yeah

145
00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:26.550
It seems like his mother is trying to separate you both.

146
00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:27.483
What?!

147
00:06:27.483 --> 00:06:28.949
Yeah, and his been grounded

148
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.766
I need to talk to him

149
00:06:32.166 --> 00:06:33.616
Alright But

150
00:06:34.366 --> 00:06:35.433
Before you talk to him

151
00:06:35.433 --> 00:06:37.366
Can i give you a peice of advice

152
00:06:37.366 --> 00:06:38.433
okay sure

153
00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:39.933
So

154
00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:42.633
You know that i support you both right?

155
00:06:42.633 --> 00:06:44.833
And im a witness with your relationship

156
00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:45.899
Yes

157
00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:46.699
And

158
00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:48.500
It'll be hard for you so

159
00:06:48.516 --> 00:06:49.366
You should be ready

160
00:06:51.016 --> 00:06:51.666
Yeah

161
00:06:51.716 --> 00:06:53.216
I know that wayn

162
00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:53.816
Ah

163
00:06:53.816 --> 00:06:55.500
A part of me is tired of

164
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.399
Chasing Him

165
00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:59.416
And avoiding his mother at all times

166
00:06:59.416 --> 00:07:00.250
And i just want

167
00:07:00.516 --> 00:07:02.683
Both of us to express our love

168
00:07:03.216 --> 00:07:05.066
Thats why im telling you

169
00:07:05.066 --> 00:07:06.300
That you should be strong

170
00:07:06.583 --> 00:07:08.449
You should be strong for your relationship

171
00:07:08.883 --> 00:07:10.566
For you and for yuri too!

172
00:07:10.966 --> 00:07:13.300
So if you ever need me just call me okay?

173
00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:15.533
Okay. thank you wayn bye!

174
00:07:15.533 --> 00:07:16.283
Thank you

175
00:07:17.966 --> 00:07:20.966
(*The Reunion*)

176
00:07:23.266 --> 00:07:25.550
Excuse me Sir, can you please help me with this-

177
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.333
Yes Ma’am, what can I do for you?

178
00:07:28.116 --> 00:07:28.949
Alejandro?!

179
00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:30.250
Is that really you??

180
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.866
Well, if it isn't Florence. How have you been?

181
00:07:32.866 --> 00:07:34.649
It’s been years since our last reunion!

182
00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:39.133
Oh please, save that conversation of yours later.

183
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.899
I didn’t expect you to be a lawyer.

184
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.783
Well, I just did. So, what can I do for you?

185
00:07:44.616 --> 00:07:46.466
I want to file a restraining order.

186
00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:47.850
A restraining order?

187
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.983
Is someone bothering or threatening you?

188
00:07:51.316 --> 00:07:54.133
No, it’s not for me. It’s for my son.

189
00:07:54.133 --> 00:07:57.133
Really? so is there someone who's threatening your son?

190
00:07:58.633 --> 00:08:01.633
Well, he has this “boyfriend” of his.

191
00:08:01.633 --> 00:08:03.933
I don’t want them associating with each other!

192
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.199
I’m sorry? His BOYFRIEND?

193
00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:09.883
Can you tell me exactly why you want to file a restraining order against him?

194
00:08:10.466 --> 00:08:14.000
Do you really need the details? I just want him gone from my son's life!

195
00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:16.866
I don’t want them associating with each other!

196
00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:20.199
I’m sorry Florence, but if you don’t give me a specific reason

197
00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:23.433
I can not help you with this What even is his name?

198
00:08:23.649 --> 00:08:26.649
His name is Keifer. Keifer Velvetine

199
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.583
What?! Thats my son

200
00:08:29.666 --> 00:08:33.016
Your son? What? No way…

201
00:08:33.166 --> 00:08:38.666
He is! My one and only Keifer Velvetine! So you’re that boyfriend’s mother he’s been talking about!

202
00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:39.649
What?

203
00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:41.600
What mother are you talking about?

204
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.183
You’re the mother of his boyfriend! Yuri! Yuri Haruka!

205
00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:52.833
No way… So why aren’t you trying to separate them both! You knew about their relationship!

206
00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:56.016
Alright, let’s get back why you are here in the first place.

207
00:08:56.016 --> 00:09:01.283
you want to get a restraining order for your son against his boyfriend? No, I can not help you with tat.

208
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.116
What? What do you mean by that?

209
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.533
You’re a lawyer aren’t you? What’s the purpose of your job if you’re not able to help me?

210
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:15.500
Don’t you know that you could have serious consequences when you’re trying to file a restraining order without valid reason?

211
00:09:15.866 --> 00:09:18.549
This is considered as an abuse of the legal system!

212
00:09:18.716 --> 00:09:22.133
Which can result in penalties and even criminal charges!

213
00:09:23.016 --> 00:09:24.000
This is absurd!

214
00:09:24.266 --> 00:09:27.350
Florence, I know that you have a strong relationship towards God

215
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:32.850
And you know that I respect that, but please, let the kids be happy. They can decide for themselves!

216
00:09:33.283 --> 00:09:36.283
Are you even hearing yourself right now, Alejandro?!

217
00:09:36.883 --> 00:09:39.883
Florence, please calm down! Think about it!

218
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.200
(*The break up*)

219
00:09:53.033 --> 00:09:53.866
Hey

220
00:09:54.299 --> 00:09:54.966
Yuri?

221
00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:56.566

222
00:09:57.083 --> 00:09:58.049
Whats wrong?

223
00:09:58.366 --> 00:09:59.433
Keifer

224
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.383
I have something to tell you

225
00:10:02.983 --> 00:10:03.683
What?

226
00:10:03.683 --> 00:10:04.533
Tell me!

227
00:10:04.866 --> 00:10:05.516
We-

228
00:10:06.933 --> 00:10:08.083
We need to break up

229
00:10:09.116 --> 00:10:09.600
What!?

230
00:10:10.816 --> 00:10:11.433
Why?

231
00:10:12.916 --> 00:10:13.716
Its just

232
00:10:14.083 --> 00:10:15.183
This is all wrong

233
00:10:15.899 --> 00:10:16.383
Keifer

234
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:16.983
Huh?

235
00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:18.166
What wrong?

236
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.399
I'm Tired

237
00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:21.899
Tired!

238
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.783
If your tired

239
00:10:24.783 --> 00:10:27.283
Why wont you fight for our relationship

240
00:10:27.283 --> 00:10:28.133
I have tried

241
00:10:28.883 --> 00:10:31.033
Tried multiple times

242
00:10:31.549 --> 00:10:32.983
Yet nothing changes

243
00:10:33.283 --> 00:10:34.850
Its draining all my life

244
00:10:34.966 --> 00:10:36.250
I cant keep up with you anymore

245
00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:40.433
I respect your desicion

246
00:10:41.366 --> 00:10:42.049

247
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.666
