WEBVTT

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:02.850
I love you yuri

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.483
I hope we stay together forever and ever

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.316
Why so sudden my love?

00:01:07.583 --> 00:01:09.799
Of course we’ll stay together and forever

00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:10.849
I love you too

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.366
Ikaw talaga ah
(*Nag lalandian ang mga juding*)

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.233
Ikaw ah
(*Nag lalandian ang mga juding*)

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:13.933
(*Nag lalandian ang mga juding*)

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.633
Where's that boy

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.433
Where's that boy

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.099
Why isn’t this boy answering?!

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:32.333
I swear if he’s with that Keifer guy again-

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:32.633
ikaw ah

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:33.450
Wait lang wait lang

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.783
Hi mom!

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.000
Yes yes yes I’m going home, don't worry

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.033
Yuri!

00:01:40.716 --> 00:01:42.233
Are you with that Keifer guy again?

00:01:42.683 --> 00:01:43.233
I swear,

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:44.816
go home right now.

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:47.183
I don’t want you hanging out with that person.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.799
He’s influencing you badly!

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.099
But Mom! I thought we'd already talked about this.

00:01:52.216 --> 00:01:53.049
I love him okay?

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.916
I don’t wanna hear your scolding anymore.

00:01:55.216 --> 00:01:57.716
I’m old enough to decide for myself and you know that.

00:01:58.083 --> 00:01:59.416
Go home at once!

00:02:04.683 --> 00:02:05.716
Whats that about?

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:06.716
*Sighs*

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:07.583
Its my mom

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:08.983
Dont worry about it

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:11.433
But I really need to go home

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.833
It’s okay I understand. I’ll walk you back home.

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:15.983
No no no its ok

00:02:16.683 --> 00:02:17.816
I'l- i'll walk alone

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:20.250
Pretty sure my mom doesn’t even want to see you anymore

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.250
sorry, I’m very sorry.

00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:23.566
Ok walk safe

00:02:23.883 --> 00:02:25.366
Call me once you got home okay?

00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:25.849
Bye!

00:02:26.616 --> 00:02:28.633
(Yuri's House)

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:33.433
(knocks)

00:02:35.183 --> 00:02:36.883
I'm Home

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:41.216
Where have you been? I’ve been worried sick-

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:42.816
Mom Just-

00:02:42.816 --> 00:02:44.533
Don't be over dramatic okay?

00:02:45.616 --> 00:02:46.816
(*Furious*) Are you with that Keifer again?

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.416
Yes i am

00:02:49.883 --> 00:02:50.383
But

00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:51.800
What is it to you?

00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:54.599
How many times do I need to say and repeat it?!

00:02:55.083 --> 00:02:56.966
Your relationship with Keifer is a sin!

00:02:57.183 --> 00:02:58.650
It’s a sin against God’s eyes!

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.250
I get what your trying to say mom!

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.683
You kept telling it to me every single time

00:03:05.083 --> 00:03:06.500
But that doesn't change the fact

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.783
That i still love Him!

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:11.516
(*Shocked*) Are you hearing yourself right now?!

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:13.000
Go to your room!

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.316
You’re grounded from now on!

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.133
What!?

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.750
But!?

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.650
(*Speechless*)

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:21.883
(*kicked the wall*)

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:24.066
(*Keifer's House*)

00:03:25.283 --> 00:03:25.916
Dad?

00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:27.533
I'm Home

00:03:30.866 --> 00:03:34.500
Son! Go ahead and eat first. I’m gonna take a nap since I have a duty later.

00:03:34.883 --> 00:03:35.283
Yes Keifer

00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:36.599
Yes Keifer

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.300
May i have your advice

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.383
Yes, What is it? Something bothering you?

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.916
Yes

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.800
Is it love life?

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.300
Yes

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:45.900
Its about that "Guy"

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.033
That Guy" the one that you have telling me

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:50.300
A million times already

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.599
Yes

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:54.500
His mother is against our relationship.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:55.883
Well may i know why?

00:03:56.633 --> 00:03:59.283
His mom is a religious person

00:03:59.533 --> 00:04:00.349
And

00:04:01.433 --> 00:04:03.516
And she says that it is a sin

00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:06.266
Uh huh…

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:07.483
Well son

00:04:07.483 --> 00:04:08.300
in this world

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.866
Everyone has a different perspectives and beliefs

00:04:10.866 --> 00:04:13.866
You can’t really change someone's mindset, right?

00:04:14.366 --> 00:04:15.750
I get your point dad

00:04:15.916 --> 00:04:17.783
But its her own beliefs

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.916
And

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.300
I think that She should not force on us.

00:04:21.616 --> 00:04:24.333
And We are old enough, to make our own decisions

00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:25.116
Right?

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:32.733
Son, I also get your point. But hear me out. You know that I support both you and Yuri, right?

00:04:33.566 --> 00:04:34.583
Yes

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.183
Right. I’m not defending Yuri’s mother, but she has the right to be against your relationship.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.550
You’ve mentioned that she is a religious person, so what can you expect?

00:04:45.716 --> 00:04:51.483
They believe that God only created men and women. A man is only for women, and women is only for men

00:04:51.483 --> 00:04:54.183
Just like what Genesis 1:27 says

00:04:55.166 --> 00:04:55.750
Dad

00:04:56.116 --> 00:04:57.633
I dont get your point

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:59.699
I'm a human i have feelings

00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:01.149
I love yuri

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:02.383
I love Him

00:05:02.716 --> 00:05:04.000
No because of His gender

00:05:04.716 --> 00:05:05.199
But

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.366
Because of

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:08.783
For who He is

00:05:08.966 --> 00:05:09.750
Do you get me?

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:11.183
I get your side son

00:05:11.366 --> 00:05:13.083
But lets face reality

00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:17.183
Like what I’ve said earlier, you can’t force your belief on someone else.

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:20.516
Everyone has a different perspective and belief's.

00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:23.300
What matters is that we respect each other, right?

00:05:23.683 --> 00:05:24.699
Yes dad

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:25.149
but

00:05:25.733 --> 00:05:26.699
I dont think that

00:05:27.316 --> 00:05:30.316
I'll- I can keep my distance from him

00:05:31.033 --> 00:05:32.000
You know?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.366
His Mom wants us to break up and never associate again!

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.266
Give it a time son

00:05:38.266 --> 00:05:40.533
Don’t rush in making decisions

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.500
I know that you’ll be able to figure it out

00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:46.233
Plus, you could talk to me when you need help, right?

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.833
*sigh*

00:05:48.833 --> 00:05:49.766
Yes dad

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.933
Thank you

00:05:52.566 --> 00:05:53.633
(*At the School*)

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.449
Hey Keifer!

00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:57.933
I haven’t seen you and Yuri around lately! What’s up?

00:05:58.516 --> 00:05:59.350
Uhh

00:05:59.633 --> 00:06:00.516
Nothing really

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.383
Have you heard anything about Yuri?

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:07.266
Well, I haven’t seen him much except when we have classes together.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.449
Im worried sick

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.933
He hasn't chatted me or called me yet

00:06:10.933 --> 00:06:12.199
Since yesterday

00:06:12.533 --> 00:06:13.433
oh, actually

00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:14.266
earlier

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.416
I peeked at his phone and i saw his mother's messages

00:06:17.416 --> 00:06:17.899
Huh!?

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:18.449
Yeah

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.783
It seems like his mother is trying to separate you both.

00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:22.716
What?!

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.183
Yeah, and his been grounded

00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:26.000
I need to talk to him

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:28.850
Alright But

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.666
Before you talk to him

00:06:30.666 --> 00:06:32.600
Can i give you a peice of advice

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.666
okay sure

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:35.166
So

00:06:35.633 --> 00:06:37.866
You know that i support you both right?

00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:40.066
And im a witness with your relationship

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:41.133
Yes

00:06:41.133 --> 00:06:41.933
And

00:06:41.933 --> 00:06:43.733
It'll be hard for you so

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.600
You should be ready

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.899
Yeah

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:48.449
I know that wayn

00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:49.050
Ah

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.733
A part of me is tired of

00:06:50.733 --> 00:06:51.633
Chasing Him

00:06:51.633 --> 00:06:54.649
And avoiding his mother at all times

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:55.483
And i just want

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.916
Both of us to express our love

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:00.300
Thats why im telling you

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.533
That you should be strong

00:07:01.816 --> 00:07:03.683
You should be strong for your relationship

00:07:04.116 --> 00:07:05.800
For you and for yuri too!

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:08.533
So if you ever need me just call me okay?

00:07:08.683 --> 00:07:10.766
Okay. thank you wayn bye!

00:07:10.766 --> 00:07:11.516
Thank you

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:16.199
(*The Reunion*)

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.783
Excuse me Sir, can you please help me with this-

00:07:20.783 --> 00:07:22.566
Yes Ma’am, what can I do for you?

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.183
Alejandro?!

00:07:24.633 --> 00:07:25.483
Is that really you??

00:07:25.483 --> 00:07:28.100
Well, if it isn't Florence. How have you been?

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.883
It’s been years since our last reunion!

00:07:31.366 --> 00:07:34.366
Oh please, save that conversation of yours later.

00:07:34.533 --> 00:07:36.133
I didn’t expect you to be a lawyer.

00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:39.016
Well, I just did. So, what can I do for you?

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.699
I want to file a restraining order.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.083
A restraining order?

00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:46.216
Is someone bothering or threatening you?

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.366
No, it’s not for me. It’s for my son.

00:07:49.366 --> 00:07:52.366
Really? so is there someone who's threatening your son?

00:07:53.866 --> 00:07:56.866
Well, he has this “boyfriend” of his.

00:07:56.866 --> 00:07:59.166
I don’t want them associating with each other!

00:07:59.483 --> 00:08:01.433
I’m sorry? His BOYFRIEND?

00:08:01.433 --> 00:08:05.116
Can you tell me exactly why you want to file a restraining order against him?

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:09.233
Do you really need the details? I just want him gone from my son's life!

00:08:09.649 --> 00:08:12.100
I don’t want them associating with each other!

00:08:12.433 --> 00:08:15.433
I’m sorry Florence, but if you don’t give me a specific reason

00:08:15.666 --> 00:08:18.666
I can not help you with this What even is his name?

00:08:18.883 --> 00:08:21.883
His name is Keifer. Keifer Velvetine

00:08:22.083 --> 00:08:23.816
What?! Thats my son

00:08:24.899 --> 00:08:28.250
Your son? What? No way…

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:33.899
He is! My one and only Keifer Velvetine! So you’re that boyfriend’s mother he’s been talking about!

00:08:34.283 --> 00:08:34.883
What?

00:08:34.883 --> 00:08:36.833
What mother are you talking about?

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:41.416
You’re the mother of his boyfriend! Yuri! Yuri Haruka!

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:48.066
No way… So why aren’t you trying to separate them both! You knew about their relationship!

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.250
Alright, let’s get back why you are here in the first place.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:56.516
you want to get a restraining order for your son against his boyfriend? No, I can not help you with tat.

00:08:57.683 --> 00:09:00.350
What? What do you mean by that?

00:09:00.483 --> 00:09:04.766
You’re a lawyer aren’t you? What’s the purpose of your job if you’re not able to help me?

00:09:04.933 --> 00:09:10.733
Don’t you know that you could have serious consequences when you’re trying to file a restraining order without valid reason?

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.783
This is considered as an abuse of the legal system!

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.366
Which can result in penalties and even criminal charges!

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:19.233
This is absurd!

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.583
Florence, I know that you have a strong relationship towards God

00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:28.083
And you know that I respect that, but please, let the kids be happy. They can decide for themselves!

00:09:28.516 --> 00:09:31.516
Are you even hearing yourself right now, Alejandro?!

00:09:32.116 --> 00:09:35.116
Florence, please calm down! Think about it!

00:09:38.433 --> 00:09:41.433
(*The break up*)

00:09:48.266 --> 00:09:49.100

00:09:49.533 --> 00:09:50.200

00:09:51.266 --> 00:09:51.799

00:09:58.216 --> 00:09:58.916

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.833

00:10:06.049 --> 00:10:06.666

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:08.950
Its just

00:10:09.316 --> 00:10:10.416
This is all wrong

00:10:11.133 --> 00:10:11.616
Keifer

00:10:11.733 --> 00:10:12.216
Huh?

00:10:12.216 --> 00:10:13.399
What wrong?

00:10:14.833 --> 00:10:15.633
I'm Tired

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:17.133

00:10:22.516 --> 00:10:23.366
I have tried

00:10:24.116 --> 00:10:26.266
Tried multiple times

00:10:26.783 --> 00:10:28.216
Yet nothing changes

00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:30.083
Its draining all my life

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.483
I cant keep up with you anymore

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.666
I respect your desicion

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.283
Okay

00:10:37.583 --> 00:10:39.899
Lets break up then

00:10:42.066 --> 00:10:42.683

00:10:43.899 --> 00:10:44.933
